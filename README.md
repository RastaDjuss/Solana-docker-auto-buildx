Howdy i don't know if this is possible...
A Solana Docker auto builder Dockerfile

# Just prepare docker and install Docker Descltop:
follow this link:
(https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
and install istructiobs..

Then run docker build commands:

,,,
docker buildx build .
,,,
Thats it it builds and tests for you

Eventually i would like to configure my multy-contain-app to deploy solana-cookbook-master also witch gives a localhost of important add ons for solana.
