# Howdy i don't know if this is possible...
# A Solana Docker auto builder Dockerfile

# Just prepare docker and install Docker Descltop:
follow this link:
(https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
and install istructiobs..

# Then run docker build commands:

Bash
docker buildx build .


# Thats it it builds and tests for you

I recomend building the solana-cookbook-master app in the same folder for important =commands and links
if you want it on localhost but its all here:

(https://solanacookbook.com/getting-started/installation.html#install-web3-js)


# Eventually i would like to configure my multy-contain-app to deploy solana-cookbook-master also witch gives a localhost of important add ons for solana.
